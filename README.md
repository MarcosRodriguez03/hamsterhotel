I replicated a website figma using html and css. It consist of bootstrap conponets such as navbars, cards, and buttons. I also use the premade bootstrap classes like rows and cols.


//Peer Review (11/03/2023) (1:32 pm); Ashur Nanno: Marcus did a very good job especially in responsiveness; I couldn't find any flaw in neither the design similarities and the resposivness; the only thing i saw that does not match the original is the squair border for the "active" nav button (Reserve); the website codes are clean written.. all in all very well done.
